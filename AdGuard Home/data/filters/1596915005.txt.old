[Adblock Plus 3.4]
! Title: ðŸŽ® Game Console Adblock List
! Version: 10February2020v3-Alpha
! Expires: 4 days
! Description: Much like there's now lists for AdGuard Home and Pi-hole to block ads on smart-TVs, here's an attempt from me at doing the same for videogame consoles with AdGuard Home. Enjoy.
! Important note: To block ads in the consoles' dedicated internet browsers with AdGuard Home, and not in the system menus, check out https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/AdGuard%20Home%20Compilation%20List/AdGuardHomeCompilationList.txt instead.
! For more information, details, helpful tools, and other lists that I've made, visit https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Wiki/General-info.md#english

! Blocks the "Theme Shop", with the intention of preventing the annoying pink dot in the upper left of the Home Menu from reappearing all the time.
! WARNING: The "Theme Shop" should be visited once to remove the pink dot, and only then should this list be subscribed to.

! â€”â€”â€” Wii U â€”â€”â€”
! Believed to reduce the initial loading time of Wii Sports Club by several seconds
! Since no third-party Miiverse clients with console support are believed to be able to exist by now (January 2020), this entry is pretty much here to stay.

! â€”â€”â€” Nintendo Switch â€”â€”â€”
! There is a system setting for getting rid of the Nintendo eShop advertisements on the lockscreen, which is hidden in System Settings â†’ System â†’ News Channel Settings â†’ Nintendo News â†’ Unfollow.
! I am considering adding "@@||104.198.251.169" as I had much more luck finding online opponents in Mario & Sonic 2020 when I whitelisted it, but it'd only be needed for those who use those converted versions of EasyList that block 104.198.*.*, and it would likely have interfered with update blocker lists.

! â€”â€”â€” Nintendo DS / Wii â€”â€”â€”
! For a largely official list to connect to Wiimmfi (for DS games only) and RiiConnect24, check out https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RiiConnect24/DNS-Server/master/dns_zones-hosts.txt

! â€”â€”â€” PlayStation 4 â€”â€”â€”
! There is a system setting for getting rid of homescreen "Buy Now"-type ads, which is hidden in Settings â†’ System â†’ Automatic Downloads â†’ Featured Content â†’ Off.

! â€”â€”â€” PlayStation 2 â€”â€”â€”
! I am not personally aware of any Free McBoot homebrew apps that can connect to external domains, let alone unintentionally.
! There were multiple third-party online game servers for the PS2, of which PS2 Online and OpenSpy are the only ones with some functionality still working.
! Any IP redirection entries for those two servers would've excluded one another; plus it appears that griefing was/is a very huge concern among the PS2 modding community, which I can vaguely presume is why they haven't openly revealed their DNS-server-side IP redirections.

! â€”â€”â€” Dreamcast â€”â€”â€”
! Although I have become aware of the existence of Dreamcast Live, I can't find the IP address redirections used by their DNS server.

! â€”â€”â€” Other consoles â€”â€”â€”
! Entry suggestions on GitHub would be much appreciated. Especially for portable PlayStation consoles, as I don't own any of them.
